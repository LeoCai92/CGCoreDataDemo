# CGCoreDataDemo
Simply use Core Data.
Recently,I am tring to learn how tp use Core Data,before this I am using FMDB to operate SQLite.
I just write four methods in this demo to simply use Core Data,about its add,delete,modify and query.
I just found that using Core Data avoid the sql,it is just like send a message to an object.
The core elements about Core Data is NSManagedObjectContext,NSManagedObjectModel and NSPersistentStoreCoordinator.
